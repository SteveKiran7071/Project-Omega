# Project-Omega

Project Goals:

• Develop and execute an experimental laboratory setup, method and analysis to quantitatively determine (1) the mass and spring stiffness of a provided mass/spring system, (2) determine the vibratory displacement response of the 1 DOF mass/spring system when subjected to free (undamped) vibration, (3) determine the vibratory force response of the 1 DOF mass/spring system when subjected to free (undamped) vibration, and (4) determine the period of vibration and the corresponding natural (circular) frequency of the mass/spring system when subjected to free (undamped) vibration.
• Provide appropriate analysis output to the user/evaluator, through LabVIEW.
• Conduct an uncertainty analysis of the measurements by examining and comparing five (5) separate tests.
• Present all your work/efforts/creations/findings within a professional engineering report.
